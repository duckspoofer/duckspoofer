# Proudly Myopic, a blog of meaningless contributions

A blog of hackneyed personal anecdotes and poorly-constructed insights by a guy can't just trust himself to live life but has to write about it as well... and publish it publicly.

The schedule for releasing new pieces will be intermittent, but I can guarantee consistency in one regard: everything will be simultaneously trivial and completely honest.
